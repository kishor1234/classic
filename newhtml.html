<p><b>Tips to prevent split ends and hair breakage</b></p>

<p>The tropical season comes with thundering clouds and excess amounts of moisture in the atmosphere that can prove to be quite cumbersome for your hair. These water molecules tend to get absorbed by your hair strands causing them to swell up, making them more vulnerable to split ends and breakage.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are several factors that damage the hair. These causes of split ends and hair breakage&nbsp; be categorized into 4 broad types which include:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Heat damage:</strong> This happens when heated stylish equipment is used too often on your hair without using a heat protectant gel. It can also occur when you wash your hair with very hot water causing the stands to get frizzy and brittle.<br />

	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Diet:</strong> Most people don&rsquo;t realise it but lack of nutrients and minerals in your daily food intake may contribute to poor hair health. It is often the cause for split ends, dryness and excess hair loss in both men and women.</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Improper hair styling practices:</strong> Excessive combing of your hair can make the strands static and prone to breakage. Tying your hair too tight or leaving it loose too often can also weaken your strands. Using excess amounts of styling products and&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Stress:</strong> Studies have shown that too much overthinking and anxiety related stress can cause your hair to fall. This is because elevated stress levels can make the follicles go dormant, hence break off the hair that is in between a growth cycle.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Split ends and hair breakage can be controlled if one can minimise the causes of it efficiently. This can be done by incorporating a few changes in your daily hair care routine to reap the maximum benefits. To make it easier to follow, I have collated a list of tips below:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Trim your hair regularly</strong><br />
	Trimming your hair every 6-8 weeks is essential to maintain your healthy locks. The longer you wait, the farther up your hair shaft your ends will split, making it frizzy and prone to breakage. Use <a href="https://www.drdivyasharma.com/">trichologist</a> recommended restorative sprags between your trims to help manage the stubborn split ends.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Avoid over-shampooing your hair</strong><br />
	Most people don&rsquo;t realise that they are using excess amounts of shampoo while washing their hair. This can be a major contributing factor toward hair damage.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	<img alt="How does over-shampooing your hair contribute toward hair breakage?" src="https://www.drdivyasharma.com/assets/website/blog/2021/08/04/01/2.png" /><br />
	<br />
	It is generally accepted that revitalizing shampoos should be used if your hair is more prone to split ends. <a href="https://www.drdivyasharma.com/book-an-appointment/">Consult a trichologist near you</a> for advice on the shampoo best suited for your hair type.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Do noy blow dry your ends</strong><br />
	Be cautious while using any heated styling equipment on your hair as they further lead to hair damage. This is because concentrating the heat on your ends causes them to dry faster and susceptible to split ends. Instead set it on low heat then use it over your root and over the length of your hair. Leave some of it air dry for effective damage control. Do not forget to use a heat protectant before styling your hair.</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Steer clear of hot water showers</strong><br />
	Scalding water is damaging to your hair as it swells up the cuticles making them more susceptible to split ends. Therefore it is always advisable to take a bath with lukewarm water or the coldest water you can stand so as to close the cuticles and seal off the outer layer of the hair.</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Use a microfiber towel to dry your hair</strong><br />
	Your hair is the most fragile when it is wet. Ensure that you only pat dry your hair with a microfiber towel as they have a gentle effect on your hair. Vigorous rubbing of hair will cause them to break, resulting in frizziness and hair fall.</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Do not pick on your hair</strong><br />
	We sometimes tend to pick at our split ends causing them to disturb your hair stands and making way for more split ends to emerge. Seek expert advice from your dermatologist on how best to manage your hair.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li aria-level="1">
	<p role="presentation"><strong>Ingredients to watch out for in your hair care products</strong><br />
	Avoid products that have sulfates, parabens, denatured alcohols, mineral oils and silicones as they strip your hair of the natural oils and moisture. Instead look for nutrient-rich hair care products that have multiple benefits such as reducing dandruff, sealing off split ends and even makes your hair shinier!<br />
	<br />

	<br />
	The Vitamin E present in these products increase the elasticity of hair strands, hence making them less prone to damage.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Even after you follow these tips, if you feel like the split ends are persisting or hair damage is not reducing, do <a href="https://www.drdivyasharma.com/book-an-appointment/">consult a trichologist</a> at the earliest. It is important to consult a hair care specialist just as you do a dermatologist for skin related problems.&nbsp; Only they will be able to rightly determine the root cause of the damage and recommend treatments to rectify it.&nbsp;</p>
